    The UpdateCompletionAfterWorkflowReturn workflow above features an update handler that returns
    after the main workflow coroutine has exited. It will (if an update is sent in the first WFT)
    generate a raw command sequence (before sending to core) of

    [UpdateAccepted, CompleteWorkflowExecution, UpdateCompleted].

    Prior to https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/pull/569, Python truncated this command
    sequence to

    [UpdateAccepted, CompleteWorkflowExecution].

    With #569, Python performs no truncation, and Core changes it to

    [UpdateAccepted, UpdateCompleted, CompleteWorkflowExecution].

    This test takes a history generated using pre-#569 SDK code, and replays it. This succeeds.
    The history is

    1 WorkflowExecutionStarted
    2 WorkflowTaskScheduled
    3 WorkflowTaskStarted
    4 WorkflowTaskCompleted
    5 WorkflowExecutionUpdateAccepted
    6 WorkflowExecutionCompleted

    Note that the history lacks a WorkflowExecutionUpdateCompleted event.

    If Core's logic (which involves a flag) incorrectly allowed this history to be replayed
    using Core's post-#569 implementation, then a non-determinism error would result. Specifically,
    Core would, at some point during replay, do the following:

    Receive [UpdateAccepted, CompleteWorkflowExecution, UpdateCompleted] from lang,
    change that to [UpdateAccepted, UpdateCompleted, CompleteWorkflowExecution]
    and create an UpdateMachine instance (the WorkflowTaskMachine instance already exists).
    Then continue to consume history events.

    Event 5 WorkflowExecutionUpdateAccepted would apply to the UpdateMachine associated with
    the UpdateAccepted command, but event 6 WorkflowExecutionCompleted would not, since
    core is expecting an event that can be applied to the UpdateMachine corresponding to
    UpdateCompleted. If we modify core to incorrectly apply its new logic then we do see that:

    [TMPRL1100] Nondeterminism error: Update machine does not handle this event: HistoryEvent(id: 6, WorkflowExecutionCompleted)

    The test passes because core in fact (because the history lacks the flag) uses its old logic
    and changes the command sequence from [UpdateAccepted, CompleteWorkflowExecution, UpdateCompleted]
    to [UpdateAccepted, CompleteWorkflowExecution], and events 5 and 6 can be applied to the
    corresponding state machines.
